    <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p> A delectable Middle Eastern dessert, baklava is made by layering sheets of buttered phyllo dough, 
            generously sprinkled with a mixture of finely chopped nuts, usually a blend of walnuts, pistachios, 
            and/or almonds. Between the layers, a sweet and aromatic combination of sugar, cinnamon, and cloves is added, 
            creating a rich and flavorful filling. </p>
        <p>Once assembled, the pastry is baked until golden brown and crisp. 
            After baking, a fragrant honey and lemon syrup is poured over the hot baklava, allowing it to absorb the sweet essence. 
            The result is a heavenly combination of crunchy layers, nutty texture, and sweet, syrupy perfection.</p>
